# Introduction Day

### What did I teach?
- First showed how to [install](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/) Python2.7
- Taught to create a variable in Python
- Introduced to Data Types
- Covered Arithmetic Operators, Comparision Operators and Logical Operators.
- Next I showed how to run Python in Command Prompt on Windows
- Solved some examples like 3+4, "hello" > "h1" on the Python console, to get the hint of how a program runs
- Introduced to Conditional Statements
- Introduced to in-built functions : raw_input(), type(), range()
- Solved an easy [example](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/py-if-else) from [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com)

### What I learned?
- I got an opportunity to brush-up on data types, logical operators
- I have been working on JavaScript more these days, so I forgot that Python doesnot use "_var_" keyword to define a variable
- Revised **if -- elif -- else** statement (got confused with the syntax again)!!
- Most importantly, I learned how should I be communicating my views/ideas to a person who is new to the concept. This implies that I am getting better at communicating my ideas.

# Days Of Helping a Friend Learn Python
I am helping a friend of mine to learn Python (who is new to Coding). 

This repository describes the activities we would be performing each day! :) 

I think in the process of teaching him Python, I am actually relearning Python and basic concepts of coding. I feel pleasured in sharing my knowledge.

## How I feel about this?

- Hmmm, I am not a teacher/tutor, so basically I am new to this concept of teaching. I was nervous in the beginning and didn't know how should I be actually doing this.
- But once I started giving introduction about Pyhton and showed how to install it on a Computer, I got in to the flow.
- I feel really happy helping my friend learn Python, as this eventualy is also helping me hone-up my Python coding skills as well as gives me an opportunity to gain skills of tutoring/teaching someone new concepts.


# !! (: _Happy Learning_ :) !!
